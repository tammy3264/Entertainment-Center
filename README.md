#Entertainment Center

This program displays some of my favorite movies in a static web page.
Click on any movie title to view the trailer.

##Installation
Make sure you have python installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


Download the zip file to your local computer. This will install a directory called Entertainment-Center.
Change to this directory.

##Directions

On the command line, type the following

```
python entertainment_center.py
```
This will open a new window displaying the static movie website.
